      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>My name is Artemis and I am a student at the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. My goal is to help others learn more about climate change, so that they can understand the threat it poses to our Earth and to humanity. Hopefully, this knowledge can inspire others to try to fight climate change and make it a larger concern in public consciousness.</p>
