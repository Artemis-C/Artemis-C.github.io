        According to NASA, there are two parts to responding to climate change: mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation involves decreasing the amount of greenhouse gases being released into the atmosphere, either by causing less greenhouse gases to be produced or by making oceans, soil, and forests more effective in storing them. Adaptation involves creating more effective planning and infrastructure to reduce the damage consequences of climate change are having on communities. Through the Paris Agreement, which was implemented in 2016, several countries have agreed to lower the amount of greenhouse gases they release into the atmosphere (United Nations). However, many climate experts believe that not enough is being done to effectively reduce carbon emissions (Euronews). This year, US President Biden has proposed a plan for dramatically reducing carbon emissions, which has garnered both praise and criticism.
